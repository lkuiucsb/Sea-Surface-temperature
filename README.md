# Sea-Surface-temperature
This is a R script for two tasks: 1. download the daily sst netcdf file from podaac.jpl.nasa.gov; and 2. extract the sst values for given locations' coordinates. 

In this code, the Santa Barbara Channel region in Southern California Bight was selected for downloading the daily sst netcdf files. If you want to download other region, you want to adjust the download lat and lon in line 30. For extracting the temperature reading for site coordinates, SBCLTER three sites and the first 10 dates in 2021 are used as examples in the R script.
